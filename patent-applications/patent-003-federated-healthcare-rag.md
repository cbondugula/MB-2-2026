Patent Application: Federated Healthcare RAG System

TITLE OF INVENTION
**Federated Learning-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Multi-Institutional Healthcare Collaboration with Privacy Preservation**

FIELD OF INVENTION
This invention relates to federated learning systems combined with retrieval-augmented generation for healthcare applications, enabling multiple healthcare institutions to collaborate on AI-powered medical knowledge systems while maintaining patient privacy and regulatory compliance.

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION

Problem Statement
Healthcare institutions face significant challenges in collaborative AI development:

1. **Data Silos**: Medical data remains isolated within individual institutions
2. **Privacy Constraints**: HIPAA regulations prevent direct data sharing between institutions
3. **Limited Training Data**: Individual hospitals have insufficient data for robust AI model training
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Cross-institutional collaboration requires complex compliance frameworks

Prior Art Analysis
Current federated learning and RAG systems lack healthcare-specific multi-institutional capabilities:

- **Google Federated Learning**: General-purpose FL without healthcare privacy protections
- **NVIDIA Clara**: Medical imaging FL but limited to imaging data, no RAG integration
- **OpenMined**: Privacy-preserving ML platform without healthcare specialization
- **Existing RAG Systems**: Single-institution focus, no federated capabilities
