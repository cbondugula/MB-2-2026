## **STRATEGIC PATENT ANALYSIS**

### **Why ACGME Requirements Are Patentable:**

1. **PUBLIC STANDARDS ≠ PRIVATE AUTOMATION METHODS**
   - ACGME requirements are public regulatory standards (not patentable)
   - **AI automation systems** that implement these standards ARE patentable
   - Patents cover the **technical methods**, not the requirements themselves

2. **NOVEL TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Machine learning models trained on ACGME standards
   - Predictive compliance analytics and violation prevention
   - Automated documentation generation and evidence collection
   - Real-time monitoring and continuous assessment systems

3. **ZERO EXISTING COMPETITION**
