# PATENT NAMING STRATEGY: CHAI REFERENCE ANALYSIS

## **DO WE NEED "CHAI" NAME IN PATENT TITLES?**

**Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Strategic Question**: Patent naming strategy for quantum CHAI compliance technologies  
**Analysis**: Legal, strategic, and commercial considerations for patent naming  

---

## **PATENT NAMING LEGAL ANALYSIS**

### **USPTO Patent Naming Requirements**

**Patent Title Guidelines**:
- **Descriptive**: Must describe the invention clearly and concisely
- **Technical Focus**: Should emphasize technical innovation, not brand names
- **Broad Coverage**: Title should not limit patent scope unnecessarily
- **Trademark Neutral**: USPTO prefers technical descriptions over brand references

**Best Practices**:
- **Technology Description**: Focus on quantum computing and healthcare AI
- **Functional Emphasis**: Highlight bias detection, compliance verification, etc.
- **Industry Application**: Reference healthcare/medical applications
- **Innovation Focus**: Emphasize novel technical approaches

### **Trademark and Brand Considerations**

**CHAI Trademark Status**:
- **"CHAI" Trademark**: Coalition for Health AI likely has trademark rights
- **Descriptive Use**: Using "CHAI" to describe compliance framework is descriptive
- **Fair Use**: Technical reference to CHAI standards may qualify as fair use
- **Permission**: Safer to avoid trademark without explicit permission

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Trademark Infringement**: Low risk for descriptive technical use
- **Brand Confusion**: Minimal risk in patent context
- **Commercial Use**: Patents are technical documents, not commercial branding
- **Legal Challenge**: CHAI unlikely to challenge technical patent references
