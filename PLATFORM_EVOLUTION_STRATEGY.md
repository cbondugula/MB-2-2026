### Technical Challenges:

1. **Infrastructure Complexity**
   - Problem: Hosting thousands of apps is expensive
   - Solution: Serverless edge functions, smart resource pooling
   - Risk: Medium
   - Mitigation: Start with static hosting, add compute gradually

2. **Security & Compliance**
   - Problem: User code could violate HIPAA
   - Solution: Sandboxing, automated compliance scanning
   - Risk: High
   - Mitigation: Strict container isolation, audit logging

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - Problem: Real-time collaboration is technically complex
   - Solution: CRDTs, operational transformation
   - Risk: Medium
   - Mitigation: Phase 3 feature, plenty of time to solve

### Business Challenges:

1. **Developer Acquisition**
   - Problem: Limited healthcare developer market (~500k globally)
   - Solution: Expand to adjacent markets (biotech, pharma, med devices)
   - Risk: Medium
   - Mitigation: Strong PLG motion, viral features

2. **Competing with Free Tools**
   - Problem: VS Code is free
   - Solution: Healthcare-specific value (compliance, templates, FHIR)
   - Risk: Low
   - Mitigation: Strong differentiation

3. **Platform Lock-in Concerns**
   - Problem: Developers fear vendor lock-in
   - Solution: Export to GitHub, portable code, open standards
   - Risk: Low
   - Mitigation: Build trust through transparency
