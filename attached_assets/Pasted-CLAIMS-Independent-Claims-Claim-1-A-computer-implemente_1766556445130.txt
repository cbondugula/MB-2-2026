CLAIMS

Independent Claims

**Claim 1**: A computer-implemented healthcare software development system comprising:
- A healthcare AI engine configured to generate medical software code using a constellation of general-purpose LLMs and specialized medical BERT models
- A compliance verification system that automatically checks generated code against HIPAA and GDPR requirements
- A medical standards translator that converts between FHIR, HL7, and SNOMED-CT formats
- A clinical safety validator that uses multiple specialized AI models including ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, PubMedBERT, BlueBERT, and RadBERT for cross-validation

**Claim 2**: The system of claim 1, wherein the healthcare AI engine comprises:
- A constellation of large language models and specialized medical BERT models trained on healthcare-specific code repositories
- A consensus algorithm that combines outputs from multiple AI models for enhanced accuracy
- A medical knowledge base containing clinical guidelines and best practices
- A context-aware code generation engine that considers medical use cases with cross-model validation

**Claim 3**: The system of claim 1, wherein the compliance verification system comprises:
- A HIPAA compliance checker that identifies potential PHI exposure
- A GDPR compliance validator that ensures data protection requirements
- An automated remediation engine that suggests compliance-friendly alternatives

Dependent Claims

**Claim 4**: The system of claim 1, further comprising a real-time collaboration system for healthcare development teams.

**Claim 5**: The system of claim 1, wherein the medical standards translator supports semantic mapping between healthcare terminologies.

**Claim 6**: The system of claim 1, wherein the clinical safety validator provides evidence-based recommendations with medical literature citations using weighted consensus from multiple specialized BERT models.

**Claim 7**: The system of claim 1, wherein the AI engine constellation includes specialty-specific models comprising RadBERT for radiology applications, PathBERT for pathology systems, and CardioBERT for cardiovascular software.

**Claim 8**: The system of claim 1, further comprising a consensus algorithm that weights contributions from different AI models based on medical domain expertise and historical accuracy.
