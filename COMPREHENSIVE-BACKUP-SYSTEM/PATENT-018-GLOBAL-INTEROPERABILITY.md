## TITLE
**GLOBAL HEALTHCARE INTEROPERABILITY PLATFORM WITH UNIVERSAL DATA EXCHANGE**

---

## TECHNICAL FIELD
This invention relates to global healthcare interoperability platforms that enable seamless data exchange and system integration across international healthcare systems, supporting 193 countries with automated protocol translation, regulatory compliance, and universal healthcare data harmonization.

---

## BACKGROUND OF INVENTION

### Field of Invention
Healthcare systems across different countries use various data formats, protocols, and regulatory frameworks making international healthcare data exchange complex and manual. Traditional platforms lack comprehensive global interoperability capabilities, requiring extensive customization for each country's healthcare system.

### Prior Art
Existing healthcare interoperability tools include: (1) Regional interoperability solutions without global scope; (2) Manual data translation requiring extensive expertise; (3) Limited protocol conversion capabilities. No existing systems provide comprehensive global healthcare interoperability with automated universal data exchange.

### Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations operating internationally need platforms that automatically enable data exchange between different countries' healthcare systems while maintaining regulatory compliance and data integrity across diverse global healthcare environments.

### Need for Invention
The global healthcare industry requires a comprehensive interoperability platform that automatically handles data exchange, protocol translation, and regulatory compliance across all international healthcare systems with universal data harmonization.
