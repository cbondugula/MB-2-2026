The invention reduces compliance verification time by over 90% while improving accuracy compared to manual processes.

---

## **TECHNICAL FIELD**

The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems for healthcare regulatory compliance, and more specifically to automated systems and methods for verifying compliance with healthcare accreditation standards using machine learning and natural language processing.

---

## **BACKGROUND ART**

Healthcare organizations must comply with numerous regulatory requirements including accreditation standards from organizations such as the Joint Commission, CMS Conditions of Participation, and state licensing requirements. Traditional compliance verification relies on manual processes, expert consultants, and retrospective auditing, resulting in high costs, lengthy verification cycles, and potential compliance gaps.

Prior art includes generic compliance management software that provides checklists and document management without automated verification capabilities. Existing systems require manual interpretation of regulatory requirements and do not provide predictive compliance analysis.

There exists a need for automated healthcare compliance verification that can analyze healthcare applications, predict compliance outcomes, and generate regulatory documentation without requiring manual regulatory expertise.

## **SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION**

The present invention provides an artificial intelligence system and method for automated healthcare regulatory compliance verification. The system employs machine learning models trained on healthcare regulatory standards to automatically analyze healthcare applications and determine compliance status.

Key innovations include:
1. AI-powered analysis of healthcare applications against regulatory requirements
2. Predictive modeling to identify compliance violations before implementation
3. Automated generation of regulatory compliance documentation
4. Real-time compliance monitoring and alerting
5. Continuous learning capabilities that adapt to regulatory changes

The invention significantly reduces compliance verification time from weeks to hours while improving accuracy and reducing costs for healthcare organizations.

## **DETAILED DESCRIPTION**

### **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

The compliance verification system comprises several key components operating in a distributed cloud architecture:

#### **1. REGULATORY STANDARDS DATABASE**
The system maintains a comprehensive database of healthcare regulatory standards including Joint Commission accreditation requirements, CMS Conditions of Participation, HIPAA regulations, and state-specific licensing requirements. The database is continuously updated to reflect regulatory changes and interpretations.

#### **2. MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING ENGINE**
A specialized training engine processes regulatory standards documentation to create machine learning models capable of automated compliance interpretation. The training process includes:
- Natural language processing of regulatory text
- Feature extraction from healthcare application specifications
- Classification models for compliance determination
- Risk scoring algorithms for violation prediction

#### **3. COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS ENGINE**
The core analysis engine receives healthcare application data including software specifications, workflow definitions, data handling procedures, and operational parameters. The engine performs:
- Automated feature extraction from application documentation
- Correlation analysis against regulatory requirements
- Compliance gap identification and risk assessment
- Remediation recommendation generation

#### **4. PREDICTIVE COMPLIANCE MODULE**
A predictive modeling component analyzes healthcare applications to identify potential compliance violations before implementation. The module employs:
- Historical compliance outcome data
- Regulatory violation pattern recognition
- Risk probability calculation
- Early warning alert generation

#### **5. DOCUMENTATION GENERATION SYSTEM**
An automated documentation system generates regulatory compliance reports, survey preparation materials, and audit documentation in formats required by specific regulatory bodies.

### **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

The system operates through the following technical process:

**STEP 1: DATA INGESTION**
Healthcare application data is ingested through secure APIs including software architecture documents, operational procedures, data flow diagrams, and security specifications.

**STEP 2: FEATURE EXTRACTION**
Natural language processing algorithms extract compliance-relevant features from application documentation including data handling procedures, access controls, audit capabilities, and workflow specifications.

**STEP 3: REGULATORY CORRELATION**
Machine learning models trained on regulatory standards automatically correlate extracted features with specific regulatory requirements, generating compliance mappings and gap analyses.

**STEP 4: COMPLIANCE SCORING**
The system generates quantitative compliance scores indicating the degree of regulatory adherence and identifies specific areas of non-compliance or risk.

**STEP 5: RECOMMENDATION GENERATION**
Based on compliance analysis, the system generates specific recommendations for achieving full regulatory compliance including technical modifications, procedural changes, and documentation requirements.

**STEP 6: CONTINUOUS MONITORING**
For deployed healthcare applications, the system provides continuous compliance monitoring, detecting configuration changes or operational modifications that could impact regulatory compliance.
